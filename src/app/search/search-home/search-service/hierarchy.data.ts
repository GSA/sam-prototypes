If included among the Nation's Fortune 500 firms, it would rank in the top 50. Its $16.5 billion appropriation comprises close to 3 percent of total Federal discretionary spending DOE Funds the largest environmental cleanup in history, and research and development that supports the Nation's defense and its energy and economic security. DOE employs over 11,000 Federal employees and about 108,000 contract employees. DOE owns and manages over 50 major installations located on 2.4 million acres in 35 States and is the fourth largest Federal landowner in the United States. DOE is an energy policy, supply, and technology enterprise. It invests in developing a secure, clean, and sustainable energy system. It helps the Nation meet its environmental challenges by administering the largest pollution prevention and efficiency program in the world, with partners from every sector of the economy. It enhances the Nation's energy security by increasing the diversity of energy, and fuel choices and sources; bringing renewable energy sources into the market, strengthening domestic production of oil and gas, maintaining the U.S. nuclear energy option, and increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and generate electricity. The Department also maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and operates five Power Marketing Administrations that sell and distribute over $3 billion of electric power generated at Federal hydroelectric plants. DOE is a national security enterprise. It is a key player in the Administration's furtherance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its overall goal of reducing the global danger from nuclear weapons. It ensures the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. At the same time, it manages and safely dismantles excess nuclear materials, and ensures the security of vital departmental nuclear assets. It provides policy and technical assistance to curb global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing U.S. nonproliferation, arms control, and nuclear safety objectives in the states of the former Soviet union and worldwide. Further, it develops and ensures the safety and reliability of nuclear reactor plants to power U.S. Navy warships. DOE is an environmental remediation enterprise. It cleans up the 50-year environmental legacy left at the industrial complexes where nuclear weapons were designed and manufactured. It manages the problems associated with the large quantities of various types of radioactive wastes, surplus nuclear materials, and spent nuclear fuels that remain at the sites of the Nation's nuclear weapons facilities and at nuclear energy research and development sites. In addition, it must address the growing inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors that is awaiting disposal. These wastes must be dealt with responsibly to ensure the safety and health of the public. DOE is a science and technology enterprise. At the center of all we do are our 27 laboratories, our additional scientific user facilities, and our researchers at the Nation's universities. These form the backbone of U.S. scientific leadership by conducting and facilitating breakthrough research in energy sciences and technology, high energy physics, global climate change, genomics, superconducting materials, accelerator technologies, environmental sciences, and super-computing in support of DOE's mission. The laboratories, described as the crown jewels of the Nation's science establishment, and the Department's funding of research at universities have resulted in 66 Nobel prize winners, including three in 1996. The Department is also an investor in the Nation's most precious resource - its youth - by supporting science and mathematics education in our schools through grants, educational programs, and fellowships. DOE is global enterprise. The outcome of our work is the technology that stimulates the private market for the expansion of clean energy to meet national and global energy requirements of almost 500 quadrillion Btu's by the year 2010 - a staggering 36 percent increase over 1995. Overseas energy market needs include coal, nuclear power, oil and gas exploration, energy efficiency, and renewable energy technologies that are available for export now or that will soon be available for the international marketplace.

One department, the Congressional Research Service, functions exclusively for the legislative branch of the Government. As the Library has developed, its range of service has come to include the entire governmental establishment in all its branches and the public at large, so that it has become a national library for the United States. The Library's extensive collections are universal in scope. They include books and pamphlets on every subject and in a multitude of languages. Among them are the most comprehensive collections of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian language books outside Asia and the Soviet Union; volumes relating to science and legal materials, outstanding for American and foreign law; the world's largest collection of published aeronautical literature; and the most extensive collection in the western hemisphere of books printed before 1501 A.D. The manuscript collections relate to manifold aspects of American history and civilization and include the personal papers of most of the Presidents from George Washington through Calvin Coolidge. The music collections contain volumes and pieces (manuscript and published) from classic works to the newest popular compositions.

The Library extends its service through an interlibrary loan system; the photoduplication, at reasonable cost, subject to conditions of law, copyright, and deposit of books, manuscripts, maps, and newspapers, and prints in its collections; the sale of sound recordings, which are released by its Recording Laboratory; the exchange of duplicates with other institutions; the sale of printed catalog cards and magnetic tapes, and the publication in book format or microform of cumulative catalogs, which make available the results of the expert bibliographical and cataloging work of its technical personnel; a centralized acquisitions program whereby the Library of Congress acquires material published all over the world, catalogs it promptly, and distributes cataloging information in machine readable form as well as other means to the Nation's libraries; a cooperative catalog program, whereby the cataloging of data by name authority and bibliographic records, prepared by other libraries becomes part of the Library of Congress data base and distribute them through the MARC Distribution Service; a cataloging-in-publication program in cooperation with American publishers for printing and cataloging /ninformation in current books; the National Serials Data Program, a national center that maintains a record of serial titles to which International Standard Serial Numbers have been assigned and serves, with this file, as the United States Register; and the development of general schemes of classification (Library of Congress and Dewey Decimal), subject headings, and cataloging, embracing the entire field of printed matter. The American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress, has a coordinative function both in and outside the Federal establishment to carry out appropriate programs to support, preserve, and present American folklife through such activities as the collection and maintenance of archives, scholarly research, field projects, performances, exhibitions, festivals, workshops, publications, and audiovisual presentations. The Center for the Book was established in the Library of Congress to provide a program for investigating the transmission of human knowledge and to heighten public interest in the role of books and printing in the diffusion of knowledge. Drawing on the resources of the Library of Congress, the Center works closely with other organiza- tions to explore important issues in the book and educational communities, to encourage reading, and to encourage research about books and about reading. Its goal is to serve as a useful catalyst by bringing together authors, publishers, librarians, booksellers, educators, scholars, and readers to discuss common concerns and work toward the solution of common problems. The Library provides technical information related to the preservation and restoration of library and archival material. A series of leaflets on various preservation and conservation topics has been prepared by the Preservation Office. Information and publications are available from the National Preservation Program Office, Library of Congress. A free national library program of braillle and recorded materials for blind and physically handicapped persons is administered by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress. With the cooperation of authors and publishers who grant permission to use copyrighted works, NLS selects and produces full-length books and magazines in braille on recorded disc and cassette. Reading material are distributed to a cooperating network of regional and subregional (local) libraries where they are circulated to eligible borrowers. Reading material and playback machines are sent to borrowers and returned to libraries by postage-free mail. Established by an act of Congress in 1931 to serve blind adults, the program was expanded in 1952 to include children, in 1962 to provide music materials, and again in 1966 to include individuals with other physical impairments that prevent the reading of standard print.

One department, the Congressional Research Service, functions exclusively for the legislative branch of the Government. As the Library has developed, its range of service has come to include the entire governmental establishment in all its branches and the public at large, so that it has become a national library for the United States. The Library's extensive collections are universal in scope. They include books and pamphlets on every subject and in a multitude of languages. Among them are the most comprehensive collections of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian language books outside Asia and the Soviet Union; volumes relating to science and legal materials, outstanding for American and foreign law; the world's largest collection of published aeronautical literature; and the most extensive collection in the western hemisphere of books printed before 1501 A.D. The manuscript collections relate to manifold aspects of American history and civilization and include the personal papers of most of the Presidents from George Washington through Calvin Coolidge. The music collections contain volumes and pieces (manuscript and published) from classic works to the newest popular compositions. Other materials available for research include maps and views; photographic records from the daguerreotype to the latest news photo; recordings, including folksongs and other music, speeches, and poetry readings; prints, drawings, and posters; government documents, newspapers, and periodicals from all over the world; and motion pictures, microforms, and audio and video tapes.

Managing the Presidential Libraries system, assisting the National Historical Publications and Records Commission in its grant program for State and local records and edited publications of prominent Americans, and publishing the laws, regulations, Presidential, and other public documents are also key functions of the National Archives and Records Administration.","code":"088","categoryDesc":"DEPARTMENT","orgCode":"ORG-1055","hierarchy":[],"orgLegacyList":[{"org_key":100076449,"legacy_id":"154d394c14ded215084894142f9989fb","legacy_name":"NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION","created_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","created_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","last_modified_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","last_modified_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","legacy_system_name":"FBO","legacy_key":4527,"source":null}, {"org_key":100076449,"legacy_id":"154d394c14ded215084894142f9989fb","legacy_name":"NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION","created_by":"IAE-DATATeam","created_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","last_modified_by":"IAE_DATETeam","last_modified_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","legacy_system_name":"CFDA","legacy_key":1480,"source":null}],"l1Name":"NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION","l1OrgKey":100076449,"links":[],"isSourceCfda":true,"isSourceCwCfda":true,"isSourceFpds":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100076449"},"logo":{"href":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/iae-federal-organization-icons/100076449.jpg"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":300000716,"name":"NATIONAL BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE","type":"DEPARTMENT","fullParentPath":"300000716","createdBy":"DATA TEAM","createdDate":"2017-12-11T20:45:04.098+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-11-22T04:04:45.675+0000","fullParentPathName":"NATIONAL BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE","startDate":"1957-07-01T04:00:00.000+0000","tas2Code":"48","fpdsCode":"4808","cfdaCode":"","ombAgencyCode":"048","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"048","level":1,"l1ShortName":"","description":"The National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 Conference Report.\n\nThe purpose of the Commission is to study the future of Medicare including Medicare and the baby boomers, the health needs of an aging population, mutigenerational perspectives, and America in the next century.","shortName":"","summary":"The National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 Conference Report.\n\nThe purpose of the Commission is to study the future of Medicare including Medicare and the baby boomers, the health needs of an aging population, mutigenerational perspectives, and America in the next century.","code":"048","hierarchy":[],"l1Name":"NATIONAL BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE","l1OrgKey":300000716,"links":[]},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/300000716"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":300000048,"name":"NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION","type":"DEPARTMENT","fullParentPath":"300000048","createdBy":"IAE_DATA_TEAM","createdDate":"2017-10-05T16:35:34.545+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-11-22T04:04:45.675+0000","fullParentPathName":"NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION","startDate":"1957-07-01T04:00:00.000+0000","fpdsCode":"9502","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"394","level":1,"l1ShortName":"NCPC","description":"NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION","shortName":"NCPC","summary":"NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION","code":"394","hierarchy":[],"l1Name":"NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION","l1OrgKey":300000048,"links":[]},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/300000048"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":500033705,"name":"NATIONAL COUNCIL ON DISABILITY","type":"DEPARTMENT","fullParentPath":"500033705","createdBy":"IAE-DataTeam","createdDate":"2018-09-17T23:05:21.018+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-11-22T04:04:45.675+0000","fullParentPathName":"NATIONAL COUNCIL ON DISABILITY","startDate":"1957-07-01T04:00:00.000+0000","tas2Code":"95","fpdsCode":"9509","cfdaCode":"92","ombAgencyCode":"413","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"413","level":1,"description":"The Council is responsible for reviewing all laws, programs, and policies of the Federal Government affecting disabled individuals, and establishing general policies for the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research and the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.

It was established to strengthen the Nation's capacity to promote international peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among the peoples and nations of the world. The purpose of the Institute is to develop and disseminate knowledge about the peaceful resolution of international conflict.  To accomplish this the Institute has set the following goals:  To provide creative practical insights through research, education, and training on negotiation, mediation, and other skills to those actively engaged in resolving international conflicts; to expand the body of knowledge about the nature and processes of peace, war, and international conflict management; and to disseminate information to the public about these subjects.  Among the Institute's instruments are grants, fellowships, a library, and in-house projects. The grants program provides financial support to nonprofit organizations, including private colleges and universities; official public institutions, including public schools, colleges, universities, libraries, and Federal, State, and local agencies; and individuals, whether or not they are associated with nonprofit or official public institutions. The Jennings Randolph Program for International Peace offers senior fellowships annually to practitioners or scholars in the U.S. and around the world who join the Institute for about ten months to work on projects concerning the sources and nature of international conflict and ways of managing conflict and sustaining peace.  The program also awards Peace Scholar Dissertation Fellowships annually to outstanding doctoral students enrolled in an accredited university in the U.S. who are researching or writing a dissertation that promises to contribute knowledge relevant to the formulation of policy on international peace and conflict issues.  The Jeannette Rankin Library Program is developing four main components on international peacemaking:  a specialized research library; a network with and support for other libraries, both specialized and public; an oral history resource; and bibliographic as well as other data bases. Institute-directed projects under the Education and Public Information Program include an educational TV program and cassette programs on such topics as U.S.-Soviet summitry and a National Peace Essay Contest for high school students.  The in-house Research and Studies is completing a broad, systematic examination of peace and conflict management theories and features workshops and seminars.

ETA fulfills a wide range of responsibilities assigned to the Secretary of Labor relating to employment services, job training, and unemployment insurance.  ETA funds training programs which enable workers to attain the skills needed for employment; administers a Federal-State employment service system which helps people find jobs and employers find workers. It also offers wage replacement programs for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, such as the Unemployment Insurance (UI) and the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs.  Special efforts are made to address the unique job market problems of groups having difficulty entering or returning to the work force, such as older workers, school dropouts, displaced homemakers and individuals with disabilities.  ETA also is responsible for promoting apprenticeship standards and programs and conducting programs of research, development and evaluation.  The Job Training Partnership Act, enacted in 1982, is designed to provide training and related education and employment services to economically disadvantaged adults and youth to ensure that they have the required marketable skills leading to productive, unsubsidized employment.  JTPA also provides reemployment and retraining services for workers dislocated through plant closings or mass layoffs. Block grants are provided to the States and U.S. territories for the operation of the program.  JTPA provides for a summer youth employment and training program and Job Corps as well as special activities which offer basic skills training, job training and support services for special targeted groups such as Native Americans, and seasonal and migrant farmworkers.  Implementing regulations for JTPA issued by the Department of Labor are contained in Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 626-638 and 675-684.  Effective July 1, 2000, JTPA is repealed and replaced by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA).  WIA establishes, with States and local communities, a revitalized workforce investment system that provides workers with the information, advice, job search assistance, and training they need to get and keep good jobs, and provides employers with skilled workers.  WIA is administered through State and local Workforce Investment Boards and required partnerships of local One-Stop Career Centers.  Funds are used for youth, adult and dislocated worker employment and training activities. The Act also authorizes a number of national programs and the Job Corps. The U.S.  Employment Service (ES) seeks to match workers looking for employment with employers seeking workers, and is operated by the States.  Programs such as Alien Labor Certification are also administered under the ES by Stat ES agencies through reimbursement agreements with the Department of Labor.  The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), or Older Worker Program is authorized by the Older Americans Act of 1965.  It provides subsidized part-time community service work for unemployed low-income people ages 55 and over.  The Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training is responsible for ensuring that programs funded through ETA are free from unlawful discrimination, fraud, and abuse.  It is the policy of ETA to ensure full compliance with constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions and to promote equal opportunity, affirmative action, and fund integrity in programs to which ETA extends financial assistance.","shortName":"ETA","sourceCfdaPk":"403f7a9ad8235974e59b29081b54632e","sourceParentCfdaPk":"1f3ae9255ccfd6a9b30efbaa76f54ca1","summary":"The Employment and Training Administration(ETA) administers and oversees a number of programs designed to assist unemployed, unskilled, dislocated workers and the economically disadvantaged get the job training and other services needed to become fully productive members of society, while improving the skills and productivity of those already employed.

Since 1901, NIST, a non-regulatory agency, has been supplying the measurements and tools—from standardized high-precision gage blocks needed to manufacture interchangeable parts to the world’s most accurate atomic clock—to help U.S. industry compete successfully through innovation. Over the last few decades, NIST has been assigned important new roles and responsibilities, including awarding competitive grants to foster development of promising, high-risk technologies; diffusing advanced technologies and business practices to smaller manufacturers; and promoting quality management methods in key sectors.  Old and new, all NIST programs support the nation’s agility, innovation, and competitiveness./nNIST Laboratory Program - For more than 100 years, NIST has maintained the national standards of measurement, a role that the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Federal Government. Today, the NIST Laboratories address increasingly complex measurement challenges. For example, NIST develops measurements focusing on the very small (e.g., nanotechnology devices) and the very large (e.g., skyscrapers), the physical—methods for characterizing strands of DNA for forensic testing and the virtual—methods for testing electronic health record systems, and tests the performance of walk-through metal detectors. The NIST Laboratories work at the frontiers of measurement science to ensure that the U.S. system of measurements is firmly grounded on a sound scientific and technical foundation. NIST promotes the use of measurements based on the international system of units (SI). The measurement science research at NIST is useful to all science and engineering disciplines. The NIST Laboratories work to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards. The NIST Laboratories provide industry and academia with unique user facilities that support innovation in materials science, nanotechnology, and other emerging technology areas through the NIST Center for Neutron Research, which provides world class neutron measurement capabilities to the U.S. research community, and the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, which supports nanotechnology development from discovery to production. The NIST Laboratories also support the development of standards and specifications that define technical and performance requirements for goods and services. These standards—also known as documentary standards—are often developed collaboratively with the private sector through an open, consensus-based process. NIST scientists and engineers lend their expertise to these efforts in order to promote standards that are based on sound science, and to ensure that the standards are supported by effective measurements and testing methods for conformity. In addition, NIST is designated under the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA) as the coordinator for all Federal agencies using documentary standards that are developed by private-sector consensus bodies to carry out their policy objectives./nInnovation and Industry Services Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership - Through partnerships between Federal and state governments and non-profit organizations, NIST’s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) provides technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers through a nationwide network in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Field agents and programs are helping manufacturers understand, adopt, and apply new technologies and business practices, as well as reap the benefits through increased productivity, better performance, cost savings, waste reduction, and creation and retention of manufacturing jobs. MEP acts as a strategic advisor to promote business growth and innovation and to connect manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased profitability and competitiveness in the global marketplace./nTechnology Innovation Program (TIP) - The TIP statute originated in the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Sciences (COMPETES) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69). The COMPETES Act was recently reauthorized as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358).   TIP was established to help U.S. businesses, institutions of higher education, and other organizations—such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutes—to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.

The program promotes organizational excellence through education, outreach, and an annual Presidential awards program. The Baldrige Award is given to organizations in six categories: manufacturing, service, small business, health care, education, and nonprofit. BPEP works closely with these organizations to recognize and disseminate proven best practices for management and operation, leading to organizations that are more strategic, innovative, competitive, and effective.

Programs include support for training of teachers and other professional personnel; grants for research; financial aid to help States initiate, expand, and improve their resources; and media services and captioned films for the deaf.","code":"9124","categoryDesc":"AGENCY","orgCode":"ORG-1480","hierarchy":[],"orgLegacyList":[{"org_key":100212978,"legacy_id":"d4cf53ca3d7a6be83b96b53a7438abe2","legacy_name":"OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES","created_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","created_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","last_modified_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","last_modified_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","legacy_system_name":"FBO","legacy_key":4599,"source":null}, {"org_key":100212978,"legacy_id":"d4cf53ca3d7a6be83b96b53a7438abe2","legacy_name":"OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES","created_by":"IAE-DATATeam","created_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","last_modified_by":"IAE_DATETeam","last_modified_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","legacy_system_name":"CFDA","legacy_key":1405,"source":null}],"parentOrg":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF","l1Name":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF","l2Name":"OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES","l1OrgKey":100001616,"l2OrgKey":100212978,"links":[],"isSourceCfda":true,"isSourceCwCfda":true,"isSourceFpds":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100212978"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":100525457,"name":"OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100001616,"fullParentPath":"100001616.100525457","fullParentPathName":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF.OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS","startDate":"2003-06-07T04:00:00.000+0000","fpdsCode":"9127","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"091","level":2,"fpdsOrgId":"9127","l1ShortName":"ED","shortName":"OSEP","code":"9127","hierarchy":[],"parentOrg":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF","l1Name":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF","l2Name":"OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS","l1OrgKey":100001616,"l2OrgKey":100525457,"links":[],"isSourceFpds":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100525457"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":300000330,"name":"OFFICE OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100000391,"fullParentPath":"100000391.300000330","createdBy":"IAE_DATA_TEAM","createdDate":"2017-10-11T18:09:07.155+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_CIV_AGENCY_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-09-14T23:19:48.510+0000","fullParentPathName":"HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF.OFFICE OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT","startDate":"1978-10-01T04:00:00.000+0000","fpdsCode":"8662","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"086","level":2,"l1ShortName":"HUD","shortName":"OSPM","code":"8662","hierarchy":[],"parentOrg":"HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF","l1Name":"HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF","l2Name":"OFFICE OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT","l1OrgKey":100000391,"l2OrgKey":300000330,"links":[]},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/300000330"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":100114291,"name":"OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING, RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100010393,"fullParentPath":"100010393.100114291","createdDate":"2003-11-20T05:00:00.000+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-11-22T04:05:54.038+0000","fullParentPathName":"INTERIOR, DEPARTMENT OF THE.OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING, RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT","startDate":"1957-07-01T04:00:00.000+0000","agencyName":"Office of Surface Mining","fpdsCode":"1438","cfdaCode":"15","a11TacCode":"8","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"014","level":2,"fpdsOrgId":"1438","l1ShortName":"DOI","cfdaBur":8,"cfdaOmb":10,"description":"Creation of a nationwide program that protects society and the environment from the adverse effects of coal mining operations, while ensuring an adequate supply of coal to meet the Nation's energy needs.
