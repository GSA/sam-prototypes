ETA fulfills a wide range of responsibilities assigned to the Secretary of Labor relating to employment services, job training, and unemployment insurance.  ETA funds training programs which enable workers to attain the skills needed for employment; administers a Federal-State employment service system which helps people find jobs and employers find workers. It also offers wage replacement programs for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, such as the Unemployment Insurance (UI) and the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs.  Special efforts are made to address the unique job market problems of groups having difficulty entering or returning to the work force, such as older workers, school dropouts, displaced homemakers and individuals with disabilities.  ETA also is responsible for promoting apprenticeship standards and programs and conducting programs of research, development and evaluation.  The Job Training Partnership Act, enacted in 1982, is designed to provide training and related education and employment services to economically disadvantaged adults and youth to ensure that they have the required marketable skills leading to productive, unsubsidized employment.  JTPA also provides reemployment and retraining services for workers dislocated through plant closings or mass layoffs. Block grants are provided to the States and U.S. territories for the operation of the program.  JTPA provides for a summer youth employment and training program and Job Corps as well as special activities which offer basic skills training, job training and support services for special targeted groups such as Native Americans, and seasonal and migrant farmworkers.

Effective July 1, 2000, JTPA is repealed and replaced by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA).  WIA establishes, with States and local communities, a revitalized workforce investment system that provides workers with the information, advice, job search assistance, and training they need to get and keep good jobs, and provides employers with skilled workers.  WIA is administered through State and local Workforce Investment Boards and required partnerships of local One-Stop Career Centers.  Funds are used for youth, adult and dislocated worker employment and training activities. The Act also authorizes a number of national programs and the Job Corps. The U.S.  Employment Service (ES) seeks to match workers looking for employment with employers seeking workers, and is operated by the States.  Programs such as Alien Labor Certification are also administered under the ES by Stat ES agencies through reimbursement agreements with the Department of Labor.  The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), or Older Worker Program is authorized by the Older Americans Act of 1965.  It provides subsidized part-time community service work for unemployed low-income people ages 55 and over.  The Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training is responsible for ensuring that programs funded through ETA are free from unlawful discrimination, fraud, and abuse.

NIFA doesn't perform actual research, education, and extension but rather helps fund it at the state and local level and provides program leadership in these areas.","code":"12H3","categoryDesc":"AGENCY","orgCode":"ORG-4450","hierarchy":[],"orgLegacyList":[{"org_key":100181287,"legacy_id":"4dd6e77a280ee2eb8bca5cf0c4183958","legacy_name":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE","created_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","created_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","last_modified_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","last_modified_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","legacy_system_name":"FBO","legacy_key":4557,"source":null}, {"org_key":100181287,"legacy_id":"4dd6e77a280ee2eb8bca5cf0c4183958","legacy_name":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE","created_by":"IAE-DATATeam","created_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","last_modified_by":"IAE_DATETeam","last_modified_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","legacy_system_name":"CFDA","legacy_key":1394,"source":null}],"l1Name":"AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF","l2Name":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE","l1OrgKey":100006809,"l2OrgKey":100181287,"parentOrg":"AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF","links":[],"isSourceCfda":true,"isSourceCwCfda":true,"isSourceFpds":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100181287"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":100109529,"name":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100035122,"fullParentPath":"100035122.100109529","createdDate":"2004-03-20T05:00:00.000+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_CIV_AGENCY_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-09-14T23:19:47.406+0000","fullParentPathName":"COMMERCE, DEPARTMENT OF.NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY","startDate":"1978-10-01T04:00:00.000+0000","agencyName":"National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)","fpdsCode":"1341","cfdaCode":"11","a11TacCode":"55","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"013","level":2,"fpdsOrgId":"1341","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/iae-federal-organization-icons/100109529.bmp","l1ShortName":"DOC","ombBureauCode":" 55","cfdaBur":55,"cfdaOmb":6,"description":"The NIST mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. Since 1901, NIST, a non-regulatory agency, has been supplying the measurements and tools—from standardized high-precision gage blocks needed to manufacture interchangeable parts to the world’s most accurate atomic clock—to help U.S. industry compete successfully through innovation. Over the last few decades, NIST has been assigned important new roles and responsibilities, including awarding competitive grants to foster development of promising, high-risk technologies; diffusing advanced technologies and business practices to smaller manufacturers; and promoting quality management methods in key sectors.  Old and new, all NIST programs support the nation’s agility, innovation, and competitiveness./nNIST Laboratory Program - For more than 100 years, NIST has maintained the national standards of measurement, a role that the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Federal Government. Today, the NIST Laboratories address increasingly complex measurement challenges. For example, NIST develops measurements focusing on the very small (e.g., nanotechnology devices) and the very large (e.g., skyscrapers), the physical—methods for characterizing strands of DNA for forensic testing and the virtual—methods for testing electronic health record systems, and tests the performance of walk-through metal detectors. The NIST Laboratories work at the frontiers of measurement science to ensure that the U.S. system of measurements is firmly grounded on a sound scientific and technical foundation. NIST promotes the use of measurements based on the international system of units (SI). The measurement science research at NIST is useful to all science and engineering disciplines. The NIST Laboratories work to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards. The NIST Laboratories provide industry and academia with unique user facilities that support innovation in materials science, nanotechnology, and other emerging technology areas through the NIST Center for Neutron Research, which provides world class neutron measurement capabilities to the U.S. research community, and the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, which supports nanotechnology development from discovery to production. The NIST Laboratories also support the development of standards and specifications that define technical and performance requirements for goods and services. These standards—also known as documentary standards—are often developed collaboratively with the private sector through an open, consensus-based process. NIST scientists and engineers lend their expertise to these efforts in order to promote standards that are based on sound science, and to ensure that the standards are supported by effective measurements and testing methods for conformity. In addition, NIST is designated under the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA) as the coordinator for all Federal agencies using documentary standards that are developed by private-sector consensus bodies to carry out their policy objectives./nInnovation and Industry Services Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership - Through partnerships between Federal and state governments and non-profit organizations, NIST’s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) provides technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers through a nationwide network in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Field agents and programs are helping manufacturers understand, adopt, and apply new technologies and business practices, as well as reap the benefits through increased productivity, better performance, cost savings, waste reduction, and creation and retention of manufacturing jobs. MEP acts as a strategic advisor to promote business growth and innovation and to connect manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased profitability and competitiveness in the global marketplace./nTechnology Innovation Program (TIP) - The TIP statute originated in the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Sciences (COMPETES) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69). The COMPETES Act was recently reauthorized as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358).   TIP was established to help U.S. businesses, institutions of higher education, and other organizations—such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutes—to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.    The final FY 2012 appropriations did not provide funding for TIP.

The program promotes organizational excellence through education, outreach, and an annual Presidential awards program. The Baldrige Award is given to organizations in six categories: manufacturing, service, small business, health care, education, and nonprofit. BPEP works closely with these organizations to recognize and disseminate proven best practices for management and operation, leading to organizations that are more strategic, innovative, competitive, and effective. BPEP also takes advantage of more than 20 years worth of learning from Baldrige Award recipients to identify strategies and practices that are most likely to strengthen the performance and competitiveness of U.S. industry and other organizations.  /n","shortName":"NIST","sourceCfdaPk":"7faa9909ffacb9b5e70c1c393f9ee720","sourceParentCfdaPk":"eb778728054c2bb65dab9a6138e024c9","summary":"The NIST mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

ODEP addresses the significant barriers to employment faced by individuals with disabilities by developing and disseminating national, State, and local disability employment policy; by fostering implementation of innovative strategies and practices among employers and throughout the various systems serving people with disabilities; by conducting disabilityrelated research to build knowledge to inform policy development; and by providing technical assistance to service delivery systems and employers to increase employment opportunities and the recruitment, retention, and promotion of people with disabilities.","code":"1667","hierarchy":[],"orgLegacyList":[{"org_key":100500130,"legacy_id":"4956c7636068e4b7218a6b9ed1881c15","legacy_name":"OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY","created_by":"IAE-DATATeam","created_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","last_modified_by":"IAE_DATETeam","last_modified_date":"2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308","legacy_system_name":"CFDA","legacy_key":1571,"source":null}],"l1Name":"LABOR, DEPARTMENT OF","l2Name":"OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY","l1OrgKey":100012049,"l2OrgKey":100500130,"parentOrg":"LABOR, DEPARTMENT OF","links":[],"isSourceCfda":true,"isSourceCwCfda":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100500130"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":100525800,"name":"OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100000000,"fullParentPath":"100000000.100525800","fullParentPathName":"DEPT OF DEFENSE.OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT","startDate":"1957-10-01T04:00:00.000+0000","fpdsCode":"97F6","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"097","level":2,"fpdsOrgId":"97F6","l1ShortName":"DOD","sourceCfdaPk":"13697d5a45fe64e02b2826cda5089798","code":"97F6","hierarchy":[],"orgLegacyList":[{"org_key":100525800,"legacy_id":"13697d5a45fe64e02b2826cda5089798","legacy_name":"OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT","created_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","created_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","last_modified_by":"FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING","last_modified_date":"2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808","legacy_system_name":"FBO","legacy_key":4690,"source":null}],"l1Name":"DEPT OF DEFENSE","l2Name":"OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT","l1OrgKey":100000000,"l2OrgKey":100525800,"parentOrg":"DEPT OF DEFENSE","links":[],"isSourceFpds":true},"_link":{"self":{"href":"https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/organizations/100525800"}}},{"org":{"orgKey":100213151,"name":"OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT","type":"AGENCY","parentOrgKey":100001616,"fullParentPath":"100001616.100213151","createdDate":"2003-11-20T05:00:00.000+0000","lastModifiedBy":"FPDS_CIV_AGENCY_START_DATE_FIX","lastModifiedDate":"2019-09-14T23:19:48.875+0000","fullParentPathName":"EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF.OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT","startDate":"1979-09-15T04:00:00.000+0000","agencyName":"Office of Educational Research and Improvement","fpdsCode":"9139","cfdaCode":"84","modStatus":"ACTIVE","cgac":"091","level":2,"fpdsOrgId":"9139","l1ShortName":"ED","cfdaBur":12,"cfdaOmb":18,"description":"Provides national leadership in expanding fundamental knowledge and improving education.
