On December 16, 2017 a notice of lapse and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by December 15, 2017. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. On November 10, 2017, Eur-Pac received approval for the welding procedures and in approved the supplier to proceed. The supplier gave us an expedited three week lead time to weld. On the November 14, 2017 work load report sent to Jim Vizvary, we stated we were trying to meet the December 15, 2017 ship date, however due to the holidays it may change to January 13, 2017. On the December 4, 2017 work load report it was stated welding was in progress and the new ship date was January 13,2018. During the holidays we received notice from the supplier the revised delivery date was January 18th. Once received and approved in inspection, the items need to go out for paint. Due to other schedule commitments of the painting supplier, the painting lead time is four to six weeks. We will do everything possible to improve the lead time. Based on the above, the new ship date is March 18 2018 or sooner. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once Eur-Pac confirms items from the welding supplier are correct, we will work with the Contract Office to confirm the new contract delivery date. UPDATE: material was received and approved to move to painting when contract was cancelled."

On December 30 2018, a notice of lapse and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by December 29, 2017. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. Modification was issued October 20,2017 extending the delivery date to December 29, 2017. On the December 4, 2017 work load report managed by Jim Vizvary, Eur-Pac stated upon inspection dimensional errors were discovered and parts were to be returned to the supplier. Considerable communications occurred with the supplier to take ownership of the error. At issue is a discrepancy of a thread dimension. The geometry indicates the thread is correct,however utilizing a thread gage indicates the thread is out of tolerance. The thread gage has been sent out for calibration to insure its correctness. The supplier has agreed if the gage results shows the thread to be out of tolerance, it will be corrected. The expected completion of this is January 22nd. If parts are approved, a new WAWF submission will occur the week of January 29th.&#xa;&#xa;Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once Eur-Pac approves the rework performed by the supplier, we will work with the Contract Office to confirm the new contract delivery date. UPDATE: the items were returned on time, inspected to be correct, and were ready to be submitted for GOVT approval when the contract was cancelled."

November 30,2017 a notice of lapse and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by November 29, 2017. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. IRPOD 20150420122601 requires the material be purchased from Mayon Plastics. Since March 2017,extensive dialog occurred with Mayon to provide material that meets the Environmental test criteria,specifically the levels of Total Organic Carbons, reported on the DCMA Workload Report managed by Jim Vizvary June 19th 2017. June 20th, Mayon requested material back to conduct their own testing. Numerous requests for status was made and on August 9th, Mayon confirmed material replacement was required. This was reported on the DCMA Workload Report August 11th. August 29th Mayon was to send a material sample from a different lot to Eur-Pac for Environmental Testing and did not arrive until September 15th. Material length, Certification, and Lot Number were incorrect. On October 16th Amanda Caisse and Bill Byrne agreed to a November 29th delivery date. Again numerous communications occurred with Mayon. Certification and material was delivered to November 6th and sent for testing November 16th, reported on the DCMA Workload Report dated November 14th. December 4th the Total Organic Carbons exceeded the limits again. December 8th Amanda Caisse requested Bill Byrne the TOC requirement be waived or provide Eur-Pac with a new source of supply. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once the decision is made to waive the TOC requirement or provide a new source of supply, a new contract delivery date would be established. UPDATE: this contract was cancelled while in Technical review."

On November 30, 2018, a notice of lapse and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by November 29, 2017. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. On the DCMA Workload Report managed by Industrial Specialist Jim Vizvary dated August 28th Eur-Pac reported the original supplier was not able to meet the dimensional requirements of the drawing. Eur-Pac found a new supplier, parts were scheduled for delivery September 26th and arrived October 9th. On the DCMA Workload report October 24th parts and supplier documentation was in review with an expected ROTI submission the week of October 30th.  During that week it was discovered the forging overlay required by contract was not included in the supplier&#8217;s documentation submission, despite being a requirement on the purchase order. Discussions resulted in the discovery the supplier did not have CAD/CAM capability to transfer drawing data and develop the forging overlay. This was communicated on the DCMA Workload report to Jim Vizvary dated November 14th. On November 20th a request was made for Technical support to allow the forging overlay to be made on a GOVT controlled drawing. On December 14th Jim Vizvary communicated Technical approval was given to proceed with the overlay onto the GOVT drawing provided Contract Officer Bill Byrne agreed. On December 15th, Eur-Pac requested concurrence from Bill Byrne, which where this issue resides as of December 19,2018. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery.  We will require final approval from the Contract Office and establish a new delivery date. UPDATE: the contract was cancelled while awaiting concurrence from Bill Byrne of the Technical approval."

The following is a full disclosure of events and activities as on December 19,2017. July 20th 2017 dimensions and quality documentation were incorrect. Considerable dialog occurred with supplier, insisting the sheets are standard sizes,provided to the Navy on a routine basis. A Request for Variance was made to approve use of the oversized sheets and was declined. This was reported on the DCMA Workload Report dated August 28th 2017. Continuing dialog with the supplier, initially would not take responsibility for the error. Eur-Pac negotiated supplier would rework the sheets to the correct tolerances. Material was returned to the supplier September 25th and reported on the DCMA Workload Report dated September 26th. On October 16th a new delivery date was agreed to between Amanda Caisse and Bill Byrne for November 29th 2017. October 12th reworked material received was rejected for poor workmanship, confirmed by DCMA QAR Jonathan Brooks. Considerable communications occurred with supplier and would not take accountability for the workmanship. On October 16th the supplier agreed to run new material, with a delivery date of December 1st. This was communicated in the October 23rd and November 14th DCMA Workload Report. Delivery from the supplier is delayed until the week of December 18th. If material is correct, Eur-Pac will present material and ROTI packet the week of January 1st and reported in the DCMA Workload Report dated December 4th.

On November 17, 2017, Eur-Pac submitted the ROTI packet for DCMA QAR review. Prior to scheduling the QAR inspection date, an audit review of the ROTI packet showed insufficient information and was withdrawn from WAWF. A request was made to the supplier to revise the certifications in order to meet the ROTI requirements. On December 12, 2017 Jim Vizvary was notified of the delay and given a new ship date of January 30, 2018. However to date we have not received the revised documents.&#xa;&#xa;Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. UPDATE: the revised ROTI was submitted for GSI inspection January 10,2018 and GSI was conducted January 17th. During GSI mandatory inspection of a different batch of product, some pieces were found to be out of tolerance, a CAR was issued and Eur-Pac disputed the CAR stating random sampling is only required and the initial sampling showed parts to print. Selection random samples by the GOVT or Eur-Pac could of different batches could produce different results at any time. During this period of debate, the GOVT cancelled the contract."

On November 30, 2017 a notice of lapse was issued and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by November 29, 2017. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. On October 25th a new delivery date was agreed to between Amanda Caisse and Bill Byrne for November 29th 2017 provided the ROTI approval was expedited, and reported on the DCMA Workload report managed by Industrial Specialist Jim Vizvary dated September 26th and October 23rd. Material was ordered October 26th arriving November 2nd. Inspection discovered two different lots of material were sent and the sample material for environmental testing was missing violating the purchase order requirement being from the same lot. This was reported on the DCMA Workload report dated November 14th. Eur-Pac is working with the supplier to establish a new delivery date that meets the purchase order requirements. This was reported on the DCMA Workload report dates December 4th. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once Eur-Pac receives a delivery date from the supplier for new material, we will work with the Contract Office to establish a new contract delivery date. UPDATE: Discussions with supplier resulted in their omission they could not meet the one lot mandate. On January 8, 2018 a request was mad to Bill Byrne. Take three feet off one roll of each lot to perform the environmental tests, and ship two rolls at 97 feet or sacrifice one roll from each lot and reduce the number of rolls on the contract from 20 to 18. This means we would have to scrap the remaining 97 feet from each of the two rolls, at a considerable cost to us. The contract was cancelled while awaiting a response."

On November 3, 2017, Eur-Pac received the items and were subsequently rejected for wrong colors per FED-STD-595. On the November 14, and December 4 2017 it was stated on the work load report managed by Jim Vizvary we were working with the supplier to confirm the error and supply us with color samples for the replacements. During this time period the supplier disputed the error. On December 11, 2017 an escalation meeting was held with supplier management. In turn the supplier confirmed the error and began developing a replacement timeline.On December 15, 2017,the supplier confirmed an expedited ship date to Eur-Pac of January 19, 2018.We anticipate the new contract delivery date will be February 2, 2018. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once Eur-Pac confirms items are correct, we will work with the Contract Office to confirm the new contract delivery date. UPDATE: replacement material has proven the supplier is not capable of meeting the contract requirements and will be returned."

On January 17, 2018, a notice of lapse and potential contract cancelation due to supplies not being delivered by January 16, 2018. Eur-Pac is disputing this notice for the following reasons. On the DCMA Workload Report managed by Industrial Specialist Jim Vizvary dated December 4, 2017, Eur-Pac reported the machining suppliers fixtures were being delayed until February 23, 2018 and a new contract ship date was April 30, 2018. Jim Vizvary confirmed a delay notice was issued. The notification of the delay pre-dates the Notice of Lapse Letter date and in turn the GOVT should had allowed for a extension to the contract ship date."

The following is a full disclosure of events and activities as on December 19,2017. July 20th 2017 dimensions and quality documentation were incorrect. Considerable dialog occurred with supplier, insisting the sheets are standard sizes,provided to the Navy on a routine basis. A Request for Variance was made to approve use of the oversized sheets and was declined. This was reported on the DCMA Workload Report dated August 28th 2017. Continuing dialog with the supplier, initially would not take responsibility for the error. Eur-Pac negotiated supplier would rework the sheets to the correct tolerances. Material was returned to the supplier September 25th and reported on the DCMA Workload Report dated September 26th. On October 16th a new delivery date was agreed to between Amanda Caisse and Bill Byrne for November 29th 2017. October 12th reworked material received was rejected for poor workmanship, confirmed by DCMA QAR Jonathan Brooks. Considerable communications occurred with supplier and would not take accountability for the workmanship. On October 16th the supplier agreed to run new material, with a delivery date of December 1st. This was communicated in the October 23rd and November 14th DCMA Workload Report. Delivery from the supplier is delayed until the week of December 18th. If material is correct, Eur-Pac will present material and ROTI packet the week of January 1st and reported in the DCMA Workload Report dated December 4th. Eur-Pac has acted in good faith to deliver on this contract and the above activities show proper and dedicated communications were made related to the efforts of contract delivery. Once Eur-Pac confirms new material is correct, we will work with the Contract Office to establish a new contract delivery date. UPDATE: material is correct was ready to present to GOVT when contract was cancelled."

CyraCom believes it would have been in the best interest of USCIS to continue the order, and CyraCom reserves its right to appeal the termination. Regardless, CyraCom is committed to serving its government customers and is ready and able to perform new orders.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;CyraCom worked cooperatively with USCIS. For example, in October 2016, USCIS informed CyraCom that contrary to prior communications, fewer than 10% of the nearly 800 interpreters eligible for transfer of existing security clearances would be able to move forward. The rest would require new security packages. CyraCom began working through the additional processes, provided USCIS with detailed status reports, and received encouragement from USCIS to continue its efforts. This continued up to the day USCIS terminated the order.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;At termination, the eQIP process had begun for interpreters of all but 3 of 69 languages (95%), and these represented an even higher percentage of estimated call volume. Of the 3 remaining languages, 1 was in &#8220;Group 3&#8221; - languages identified in the order as so &#8220;rarely requested&#8221; that USCIS would provide 2 weeks&#8217; notice to schedule services; and the remainder were in &#8220;Group 2.&#8221; All of the most common languages from &#8220;Group 1&#8221; had been submitted. CyraCom confirmed this status to USCIS the day before termination. To allow performance to proceed, CyraCom had also offered to limit the account to the 66 languages in process. &#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;We were thus disappointed to receive the termination. We note also that CyraCom recently submitted interpreters for a USCIS Western Region order, with 7 districts and even more languages than the District 9 order. CyraCom is prepared to successfully support its government customers."

Reagent World ultimately submitted an equipment list for approval to complete the work according to the onsite POC&#8217;s requirements, which resulted in a substantial cost increase.

We used two sources to complete the contract and some individual product counts totaled more than ordered but it was the only way to meet the quantity ordered.  This happened with at least two products.  However, communication between Sungro, SIAD receiving, contracting,and Vendors went awry and problems developed.  SIAD agreed to take products that matched their quantity orders and returned the balance.  Not a great experience but we worked to resolve to the end."
