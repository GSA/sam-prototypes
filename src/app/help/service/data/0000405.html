<h4>Before You Start<\/h4> <ul> <li>You must use your work email address as your user id.<\/li> <li>You will need two methods for multi-factor authentication.  We recommend that you use your federal CAC/PIV card as your primary method of signing in.  You will also need to identify as second method.  Options include SMS text, phone call, an authentication app, and email.<\/li> <\/ul> <h4>Contractors with a Federal Email address<\/h4> <p>If you are a contractor working for a federal agency and have a federal email address, you are allowed to create a federal account at login.gov and to register as a federal user in SAM.  The agency will determine what, if any, roles you may be assigned.<\/p> <h4>Creating a login.gov account<\/h4> <p>SAM uses login.gov as it's single-sign-on provider. When you sign up, you will be redirected to login.gov.<\/p> <h4>Completing your profile at SAM.gov<\/h4> <p>After you complete your sign-up at login.gov, you will be redirected back to SAM to complete your profile.  SAM collects minimal information.<\/p> <h4>Selecting your Organization<\/h4> <p>As a federal user, you must identify the organzation for which you work. Your department or independent agency will already be selected, based on your email address.  Unless you work at the top level of your organization, you should also identiy the sub-tier where you work.  This will make it easier for administrators to find you and manage roles.<\/p>
